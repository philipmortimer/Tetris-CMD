Tetris command line (or web browser) game implemented in Haskell. Completed this as part of a University excercise. Ensure that ansi-terminal is installed with " cabal install ansi-terminal". You will also need QuickCheck and random alongside haskell for this to work. I have attached samples of the project in action.
